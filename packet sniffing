## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize network traffic using packet sniffing techniques. It captures network packets, processes them, and provides meaningful visualizations to understand the network behavior.

## Features
- Real-time packet capturing
- Protocol analysis
- Data visualization
- Traffic statistics

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scapy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-traffic-analysis.git
